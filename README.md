# Real-Estate-Chatbot
In our project to create a chatbot for a real estate company, our team embarked on leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The primary goal was to develop an intuitive and responsive chatbot capable of understanding user queries regarding property listings, location details, pricing, and other pertinent information related to real estate. Through meticulous training and refining of the chatbot using machine learning algorithms, we ensured that it could interpret and respond accurately to a wide array of user inquiries, enhancing customer engagement and providing valuable assistance in navigating the complexities of the real estate market.

 The chatbot considered the three following scenarios: 
 1. Buy a house
 2. Testing
